# Student Portal - Database Schema Documentation

## Overview

The Student Portal uses a comprehensive relational database with 7 tables, all with Row Level Security (RLS) enabled. This ensures data privacy and proper access control based on user roles.

## Key Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All tables have RLS enabled to ensure:
- Users can only access their own data
- Admins have full access
- Enrollment data is private
- Academic records are confidential

### Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned data
- CHECK constraints enforce valid values
- UNIQUE constraints prevent duplicates
- Generated columns calculate percentage automatically

### Performance
- Strategic indexes on frequently queried columns
- Foreign key indexes for joins
- Status and date indexes for filtering

### Audit Trail
- `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps on all tables
- Track who created/modified content
- Historical data preservation

## Access Control Matrix

| Table | Student Read | Student Write | Admin Read | Admin Write |
|-------|--------------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| users | Own only | Own only | All | All |
| courses | All | None | All | All |
| enrollments | Own only | Own (request) | All | All |
| student_profiles | Own only | Own | All | All |
| course_materials | Enrolled courses | None | All | All |
| grades | Own only | None | All | All |
| notifications | Own only | Own (mark read) | All | All |

## Migration Strategy

All tables are created through Supabase migrations with:
1. Proper migration naming (001_*, 002_*, etc.)
2. Detailed documentation in migration comments
3. Comprehensive RLS policy setup
4. Index creation for performance
5. Constraint definitions for data integrity

---

## Future Considerations

1. **Archiving** - Soft delete for historical records
2. **Audit Logging** - Track all data changes
3. **Full-text Search** - Enable on descriptions
4. **Caching** - Redis for frequently accessed data
5. **Replication** - Database backup strategy
6. **Analytics** - Summary tables for reporting

## Example Queries

### Get student's enrolled courses
```sql
SELECT c.* FROM courses c
INNER JOIN enrollments e ON c.id = e.course_id
WHERE e.student_id = 'uuid' AND e.status = 'approved';
```

### Get pending enrollment requests
```sql
SELECT e.*, c.name, u.name as student_name
FROM enrollments e
JOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.id
JOIN users u ON e.student_id = u.id
WHERE e.status = 'pending'
ORDER BY e.request_date DESC;
```

### Get student's grades with course info
```sql
SELECT g.*, c.name as course_name, e.id as enrollment_id
FROM grades g
JOIN enrollments e ON g.enrollment_id = e.id
JOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.id
WHERE e.student_id = 'uuid'
ORDER BY g.graded_date DESC;
```

### Get course analytics
```sql
SELECT
  c.id,
  c.name,
  COUNT(e.id) as total_enrollments,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN e.status = 'approved' THEN 1 END) as approved,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN e.status = 'pending' THEN 1 END) as pending,
  AVG(g.percentage) as avg_grade
FROM courses c
LEFT JOIN enrollments e ON c.id = e.course_id
LEFT JOIN grades g ON e.id = g.enrollment_id
GROUP BY c.id, c.name;
```
