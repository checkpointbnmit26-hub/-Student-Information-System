- `created_at` - Automatic timestamp
- `updated_at` - Automatic timestamp
- `percentage` - Generated from grades

### Enum-like Constraints
- `users.role` → 'student' | 'admin'
- `enrollments.status` → 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected'
- `course_materials.material_type` → 'lecture' | 'assignment' | 'resource'
- `notifications.type` → 'enrollment' | 'grade' | 'announcement' | 'system'

### Default Values
- `courses.capacity` → 50
- `courses.enrolled_count` → 0
- `enrollments.status` → 'pending'
- `student_profiles.gpa` → 0.00
- `grades.max_score` → 100
- `notifications.is_read` → false

## Ready for Production

The database is production-ready with:

✓ **Security**: Row Level Security on all tables
✓ **Performance**: Strategic indexes for fast queries
✓ **Integrity**: Foreign keys and constraints
✓ **Scalability**: UUID-based design
✓ **Auditability**: Timestamp tracking
✓ **Compliance**: Data isolation and privacy

## Next Steps

### 1. Connect Frontend to Database
Update your frontend API calls to use Supabase client:

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);

// Example: Get courses
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('courses')
  .select('*');
```

### 2. Implement Authentication
Use Supabase Auth or integrate with your login system:

```typescript
const { user, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
  email: 'student@example.com',
  password: 'password'
});
```

### 3. Create Database Queries
Implement CRUD operations for each table:

```typescript
// Create enrollment request
await supabase
  .from('enrollments')
  .insert([{ student_id: uid, course_id: cid, status: 'pending' }]);

// Get student's enrollments
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('enrollments')
  .select('*, courses(*)')
  .eq('student_id', userId)
  .eq('status', 'approved');
```

### 4. Add Real-time Features (Optional)
Subscribe to database changes:

```typescript
const subscription = supabase
  .from('enrollments')
  .on('UPDATE', payload => console.log(payload))
  .subscribe();
```

---

## Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Always use WHERE clauses** with indexed columns
2. **Select only needed columns** to reduce payload
3. **Use pagination** for large result sets
4. **Cache frequently accessed data** (courses, materials)
5. **Archive old notifications** to keep table lean
6. **Monitor query performance** in Supabase dashboard

## Backup & Recovery

Supabase provides:
- Automatic daily backups
- Point-in-time recovery
- Replication for high availability
- Disaster recovery plans

Access backups via Supabase dashboard → Database → Backups

---

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Monitor
- Query performance in Supabase dashboard
- Database size growth
- RLS policy execution
- Index usage

### Maintain
- Review slow queries monthly
- Archive old data (notifications)
- Update statistics
- Verify backups

## Common Queries

### Student Dashboard Data
```sql
-- Get student's enrolled courses
SELECT c.*, e.status
FROM courses c
JOIN enrollments e ON c.id = e.course_id
WHERE e.student_id = $1 AND e.status = 'approved'
ORDER BY c.start_date DESC;
```

### Admin Dashboard Data
```sql
-- Get enrollment statistics
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT e.student_id) as total_students,
  COUNT(DISTINCT e.course_id) as total_courses,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN e.status = 'pending' THEN 1 END) as pending_requests
FROM enrollments e;
```

### Grade Analytics
```sql
-- Get course average grades
SELECT
  c.name,
  AVG(g.percentage) as avg_score,
  MIN(g.percentage) as min_score,
  MAX(g.percentage) as max_score,
  COUNT(g.id) as total_grades
FROM courses c
LEFT JOIN enrollments e ON c.id = e.course_id
LEFT JOIN grades g ON e.id = g.enrollment_id
WHERE e.status = 'approved'
GROUP BY c.id, c.name;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: RLS Policy Error
**Solution**: Check that your user is authenticated and has the correct role

### Issue: Slow Queries
**Solution**: Check Supabase dashboard for missing indexes; create indexes on frequently queried columns

### Issue: Cascading Delete Issues
**Solution**: Check foreign key relationships; ensure referenced records exist

### Issue: Duplicate Enrollment
**Solution**: enrollments has UNIQUE(student_id, course_id) constraint; check for existing enrollment
