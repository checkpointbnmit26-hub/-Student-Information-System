## Running the Application

### Frontend (React + Vite)

The frontend is already configured and ready to run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:5173`

### Backend (Node.js + Express)

The backend is set up but not connected. To run it:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:3001`

**Note**: Currently, the frontend uses dummy data and does not connect to the backend API.

## Design Highlights

- **Color Palette**: Blue gradient theme (#2563eb to #1e40af)
- **Typography**: Inter font family with multiple weights
- **UI Components**: Clean cards with soft shadows and rounded corners
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions, hover effects, and fade-in animations
- **Responsive**: Fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
